# CS-433 Project 2: Road Segmentation

**This README should allow anyone to replicate our obtained results, for more detailed results,  interpretations, methodology see our report.**

## Introduction

This is a witty introduction to this fantastic subject we are very passionate about.

## Project structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
.
├── dataset                 # Location of the compressed dataset
│   ├── train.csv           # The training data set, with labels
│   └── test.csv            # The testing data set, no labels
├── template                # Template files given to us
├── pictures                # Contains some pictures for this README and the report
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

> Important: All files and scripts are designed for Python 3.

## Data set

The data set can be downloaded [the EPFL private challenge](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/epfl-ml-road-segmentation). From the description we see that the data is structured as follows: 

- **test set images**
- **training set**

Our task is to create the following file:

- **submission.csv** - A row should have label -1 if the features are predicted to be background noise, 1 if a higgs boson is detected.
